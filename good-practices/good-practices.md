# What is it

Good practices are related to build more efficient, organized, clean and overall better code, by following patterns. Code should be written in such a way that it's maintainable, robust, verifiable, and readable. This is why developers need to constantly find and learn new ways to write better code.

## Here some of one this best practices:

# CSS

### Atomic

### SuitCSS

### BEM - Block Element Modifier

Improving Organization in CSS through nomenclatures that divide into:

- Block: standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. Example: header, container, menu
- Element: a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. Example: menu item, list item, header title
- Modifier: a flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior. Example: disabled, checked, fixed, size big.

```
menu__item--disabled
```

# HTML

# Design Patterns

# What is it

# DRY - Don’t repeat yourself

The same piece of code should not be repeated over and over again.

# Design Patterns

# Design System

Set of pre-established and consensual standards aimed at improving developer and user usage and efficiency,

# Micro frontends

Microservices techniques also applied in front-end development

# MVC (Model View Controller)

Just as we have the division between back and front to establish the division between the business rule and interface, inside the backend we also have a division of layers and responsibilities. MVC corresponds to an architectural pattern that divides the elements of this application into three layers:

Model

View

Controller

# MVVM (Model View ViewModel)

### Blank Lines and Indentation

- Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.

- For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.

- For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.
