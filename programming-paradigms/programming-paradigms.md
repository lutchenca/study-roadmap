# Functional Programming

Is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions.

Functional programming harnesses language support by using functions as variables, arguments, and return values—creating elegant and clean code in the process. FP also uses immutable data and avoids concepts like shared states. This is in contrast to object-oriented programming (OOP), which uses mutable data and shared states.

Functional programming languages focus on declarations and expressions rather than the execution of statements. Functions are also treated like first-class citizens—meaning they can pass as arguments, return from other functions, and attach to names.

## Advantages of Functional Programming

- **Modularity** – As previously mentioned, functional programming is highly modular. This makes the resulting code shorter and easier to read. Anyone who has tried to decipher monolithic code would appreciate the simplicity.
- **You can implement lambda calculus in the program** – You can use this to solve complex problems.
- **Contains many functional constructs** – These include lazy map, lazy evaluation, and lists.
- **Some programming languages support nested functions** – This significantly improves the maintainability of the code.
- **Problems are easier to pinpoint and solve** – FP’s reliance on pure functions makes debugging and unit testing easier. Pure functions also prevent confusing issues and errors from developing in the code.
- **Keeps concurrency safe** – Code is thread-safe when no two concurrent processes try to access the same data simultaneously. This bug is a race condition. Since pure functions never share a state with other sections of the program, race conditions can’t occur.
