### What is seed data

When you write tests for the backend, you need to test for four different kinds of operations:

- Create (for adding things to the database)
- Read (for getting things from the database)
- Update (for changing the database)
- Delete (for deleting things from the database)

The easiest type to test for is create operations. You put something into the database and test whether itâ€™s there. For the other three types of operations, you need to put something into the database before you write the test.

**The process where you add initial content to a database is called seeding.**
