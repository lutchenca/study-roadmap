# Personal Study Roadmap :notebook::girl:

My personal learning roadmap on Web Development and Programming containing all the topics I'm studying/studied.
Learning in public is simply sharing your process of study and learning... in public - pretty easy, huh? We have a lot of articles and statitics that shows that sharing your knowledge is the best way to do anything, because when you teach or talk to someone, you have to find differents ways to explain, and this is great for you! Also the IT comunity is helping me a lot trough my journey and I am trying to somekind way retribute. You can use this repository by entering on every folder and reading the notes I'm making about each topic.

## How this repo works

I'm gonna create folders with themes that I'm working/studying on and feeding them with every stuff and resource that helped me to understand the concept, so you can see my code/text/whatever-media-i-used and talk to me, sounds great, right? Feel free to discuss and help me to improve. Every folder has it own markdown file specifying what it is about, that's it! Also, I hope that you get inspired by this and made your own.

Navigate to the folder you want to see and read the markdown file. Everything is in alphabetical order, so you can find the topic you're looking for.
